What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: It creates an git repo, there are no commits. It is needed to allow commits to happen.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: it is a place to group your "working set". It seperates it from the working directory and repo. You can keep changes as small as you'd like.
