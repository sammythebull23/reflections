How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I could see the line that changed to examine what might be wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You could follow thought process and also rollback if there were major problems. You could compare to current to see how the file has changed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Development of different changes often requires modifications across files and you usually make the change and commit all at the same time to test.
